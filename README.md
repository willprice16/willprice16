My first solo project was titled "Understanding the Dataset and Exploring Predictive Models for Diagnosing Specific Language Impairment in Children". Data was obtained from kaggle @ https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgokeeffe/specific-language-impairment

The objective of this project can be broken down into two distinct areas:
To Understand the dataset on SLI through data analysis, use descriptive statistics to understand the variables and investigate correlation to identify relationships between the variables. 
And to Look into classification models: Logistic Regression Model, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, Decision Tree Classification, Gaussian NaÃ¯ve Bayes, K-Neighbours Classifier, Support Vector Classifier 

The outcome of this project was fantastic winning me 2nd place overall at the innovation fair, winning me Â£150 and a certificate of completion!
